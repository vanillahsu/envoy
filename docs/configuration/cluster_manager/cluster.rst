.. _config_cluster_manager_cluster_name:

name
  *(required, string)* Supplies the name of the cluster which must be unique across all clusters.
  The cluster name is used when emitting :ref:`statistics <config_cluster_manager_cluster_stats>`.

type
  *(required, string)* The :ref:`service discovery type <arch_overview_service_discovery_types>` to
  use for resolving the cluster. Possible options are *static*, *strict_dns*, *logical_dns*, and
  *sds*.

connect_timeout_ms
  *(required, integer)* The timeout for new network connections to hosts in the cluster specified
  in milliseconds.

lb_type
  *(required, string)* The :ref:`load balancer type <arch_overview_load_balancing_types>` to use
  when picking a host in the cluster. Possible options are *round_robin*, *least_request*, and
  *random*.

hosts
  *(sometimes required, array)* If the service discovery type is *static*, *strict_dns*, or
  *logical_dns* the hosts array is required. How it is specified depends on the type of service
  discovery:

  static
    Static clusters must use fully resolved hosts that require no DNS lookups. Both TCP and unix
    domain sockets (UDS) addresses are supported. A TCP address looks like:

    ``tcp://<ip>:<port>``

    A UDS address looks like:

    ``unix://<file name>``

    A list of addresses can be specified as in the following example:

    .. code-block:: json

      [{"url": "tcp://10.0.0.2:1234"}, {"url": "tcp://10.0.0.3:5678"}]

  strict_dns
    Strict DNS clusters can specify any number of hostname:port combinations. All names will be
    resolved using DNS and grouped together to form the final cluster. If multiple records are
    returned for a single name, all will be used. For example:

    .. code-block:: json

      [{"url": "tcp://foo1.bar.com:1234"}, {"url": "tcp://foo2.bar.com:5678"}]

  logical_dns
    Logical DNS clusters specify hostnames much like strict DNS, however only the first host will be
    used. For example:

    .. code-block:: json

      [{"url": "tcp://foo1.bar.com:1234"}]

.. _config_cluster_manager_cluster_service_name:

service_name
  *(sometimes required, string)* This parameter is required if the service discovery type is *sds*.
  It will be passed to the :ref:`SDS API <config_cluster_manager_sds_api>` when fetching cluster
  members.

:ref:`health_check <config_cluster_manager_cluster_hc>`
  *(optional, object)* Optional :ref:`active health checking <arch_overview_health_checking>`
  configuration for the cluster. If no configuration is specified no health checking will be done
  and all cluster members will be considered healthy at all times.

max_requests_per_connection
  *(optional, integer)* Optional maximum requests for a single upstream connection. This
  parameter is respected by both the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 connection pool implementations. If not
  specified, there is no limit. Setting this parameter to 1 will effectively disable keep alive.

:ref:`circuit_breakers <config_cluster_manager_cluster_circuit_breakers>`
  *(optional, object)* Optional :ref:`circuit breaking <arch_overview_circuit_break>` settings
  for the cluster.

:ref:`ssl_context <config_cluster_manager_cluster_ssl>`
  *(optional, object)* The TLS configuration for connections to the upstream cluster. If no TLS
  configuration is specified, TLS will not be used for new connections.

.. _config_cluster_manager_cluster_features:

features
  *(optional, string)* A comma delimited list of features that the upstream cluster supports.
  The currently supported features are:

  http2
    If *http2* is specified, Envoy will assume that the upstream supports HTTP/2 when making new
    HTTP connection pool connections. Currently, Envoy only supports prior knowledge for upstream
    connections. Even if TLS is used with ALPN, *http2* must be specified. As an aside this allows
    HTTP/2 connections to happen over plain text.

.. _config_cluster_manager_cluster_http_codec_options:

http_codec_options
  *(optional, string)* Additional options that are passed directly to the codec when initiating
  HTTP connection pool connections. These are the same options supported in the HTTP connection
  manager :ref:`http_codec_options <config_http_conn_man_http_codec_options>` option. When building
  an HTTP/2 mesh, if it's desired to disable HTTP/2 header compression the *no_compression*
  option should be specified both here as well as in the HTTP connection manager.

.. _config_cluster_manager_cluster_dns_refresh_rate_ms:

dns_refresh_rate_ms
  *(optional, integer)* If the dns refresh rate is specified and the cluster type is either *strict_dns*,
  or *logical_dns*, this value is used as the cluster's dns refresh rate. If this setting is not specified,
  the value defaults to 5000. For cluster types other than *strict_dns* and *logical_dns* this setting is
  ignored.

.. _config_cluster_manager_cluster_outlier_detection:

outlier_detection
  *(optional, object)* If specified, outlier detection will be enabled for this upstream cluster.
  Currently the presence of the empty object enables it and there are no options. See the
  :ref:`architecture overview <arch_overview_outlier_detection>` for more information on outlier
  detection.
